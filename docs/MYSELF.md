# ShawarmaKernel 0.1

Welcome, brave traveler.  

This is a hobby OS, crafted from scratch, entirely new and daring in its ambition.  

The kernel is POSIX-compatible, a humble yet steadfast companion in the digital wilds.  

May fortune guide my future self through debugging, segmentation faults, and memory leaks.  

— Your past self,
